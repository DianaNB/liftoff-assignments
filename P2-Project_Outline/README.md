# Project Outline

## Overview

This is a music web application that will allow users to create, add, edit, & share playlists based on users music preferences.This will create a space for music lovers far and wide to find, learn, and share music with others in a fun collabritive way. This is the foundation of a larger idea for a music finder app that will eventually be able to identify new music for the user based off more technical makeup of the music. The basis of this liftoff is to create a space where music lovers can find and identify new music trends and new music from around the world.

### Necessary To Learn
* I will need to know how to incoporate a music database API so that the users can find and add songs. I need to figure out how multiple people can work on a playlist together as well. I'm sure as I continue mapping out my project I will discover move things I need to learn.
